Viewport Genie
==============

### Adds the "real" viewport width and height (in px and em) as an element on the body to help with obtaining values for responsive breakpoints

Use it in conjunction with mqGenie (https://github.com/stowball/mqGenie) to trigger the correct breakpoints in non-WebKit browsers

**Usage:**

Use the bookmarklet to quickly get the viewport size on any page: http://mattstow.com/git/viewport-genie/bookmarklet.html

Or include `viewport.genie.min.js` in your page somewhere after the opening `<body>` tag, and trigger it with a querystring parameter of `genie=true`
